# Unmixing_Python

## 1.Introduction
This is a program for deep learning based hyperspectral unmixing, mainly to do blind unmixing. The main purpose here is to document the experiments and information that have been done, as well as to provide a program code solution for running the experiments.

## 2.Usage
- Install the python library via requirements.txt, or install it yourself (recommended version is at least py37+pytorch 1.0.0);
- Just write the configuration information under `config/main_config.yaml` and click `main.py` to run it.
